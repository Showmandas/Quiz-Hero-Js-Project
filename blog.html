        <h4>What is event loop and how does it work?</h4>
        <p>We know that Javascript is a synchronus and single threaded language.It executes the line of code one at a time or line by line serially.But in some scenarios it behaves as an asynchronus.If we see as an example of timer or setInterval,setTimeOut funtion,these are works as .In this situation this mechanism handle this.It manages the cycle of callback function from the queue to the call stack.<br>
        A call stack will be empty for bringing anything in it for event loop.When the call stack  is empty,the first unit will be entered to the queue to bring to the call stack by the event loop</p>
